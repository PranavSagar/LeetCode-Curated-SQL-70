## 1285. Find the Start and End Number of Continuous Ranges

---

**MEDIUM**   


SQL Schema  
Table: Logs  
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```
log_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
 

Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in the table Logs.

Return the result table ordered by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:   
Logs table:  
```
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+
```
Output: 
```
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
```
Explanation:   
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.  
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.  
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table   
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.  
Number 9 is missing from the table.  
Number 10 is contained in the table.

with cte as
(select
    log_id,log_id - row_number() over(order by log_id) as diff
from
    Logs)

select
    min(log_id) as start_id,max(log_id) as end_id
from
    cte
group by
    diff
order by
    start_id;
```
