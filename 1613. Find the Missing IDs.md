## 1613. Find the Missing IDs
---

**MEDIUM**

SQL Schema  
Table: Customers  
  ```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:   
Customers table: 
```
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
```
Output: 
```
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
```
Explanation:   
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.

## Solution

```
with recursive  cte (id) as
(    select
        1
    union all
    select
        id + 1 
    from
        cte
    where
        id < ( select max(customer_id) from Customers))
                
select 
    cte.id as ids
from
    cte  left join Customers
on
    cte.id = Customers.customer_id
where
    Customers.customer_id is null

```


```
with recursive  cte (id) as
(    select
        1
    union all
    select
        id + 1 
    from
        cte
    where
        id < ( select max(customer_id) from Customers))
                
select 
    ids
from 
    cte
where 
    ids not in (select customer_id from Customers)
order by 
    ids

```
