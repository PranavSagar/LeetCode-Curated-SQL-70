---  

**Easy**  

SQL Schema
Table: Employee
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| team_id       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
 

Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:  

Input:   
Employee Table:  
```
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
```
Output:
``` 
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
```

                        team_id, count(employee_id) as team_size
                    from
                        Employee
                    group by
                        team_id) c
on e.team_id = c.team_id
